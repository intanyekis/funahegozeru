But then turn down a fade when a n***a came up to him for the fade, turned it down. I’m not cool with n****s like that,” Jackson explained in a clip (see below) that’s been circulating across social media. “If he wants to fight women and stuff like that—to me, I can’t operate like that, because you get so many of those and especially once they there and it’s like, it’s unfortunate because I’m a fan of this s**t! I can separate the man from the artist, but sometimes it starts getting a little too muddy for me.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everybody can’t be lying on this man. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/YK9YnI2HRp</a></p><p>— FailedBaldGayGeezer (@KirkWrites79) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 24, 2022</a></p><p>At the top of 2022 when former women’s college basketball star Dylan Gonzalez <a href=#>accused</a> Songz of being a rapist, Jackson <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a> in a since-deleted tweet, “HE IS A B***H!! F**K THAT B***H A**! Hope he gets what he deserves. Can’t stand his disrespectful b***h a**. F**k him.”</p><p>Songz is <a href=# rel=nofollow>currently being sued</a> for $20 million in a new sexual assault case where the alleged victim claims she was raped anally by the singer at his home. She told investigators that she screamed throughout the alleged ordeal, pleading for him to stop. Following the incident, she claims she went to the hospital where she was told there was “severe anal tearing that could require surgery.” This is one of three ongoing investigations for Trey Songz.</p><p>Listen to the rest of the&nbsp;Boys Next Door&nbsp;podcast with&nbsp;Sarunas J.
