She donned a black floor-length coat featuring red and yellow flowers over a long white custom Loewe dress. Wintour paired the look with her signature bob.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/See-Which-Foods-Anna-Wintour-Banned-from-the-Met-Gala-2.jpg><p>Ahead of the event, Wintour hinted that her look may include a floral element. “I imagine we’ll see a lot of flowers,” Wintour said while teasing that she will possibly be wearing them herself, saying, “Possibly.”</p><p>Wintour also <a href=#>offered a public apology</a> to those who were perplexed by the theme. “This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,” Wintour told Bush Hager on Monday. “When we came up with the title ‘Sleeping Beauties,’ it’s wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually, it could be many, many things.”</p><p>Wintour noted that she asked for dress code advice from the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute curator, <strong>Andrew Bolton</strong>.</p><p>“I said, ‘What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?’ And he said, ‘Well, what about ‘Garden of Time?’” Wintour recalled. “So, I fear that we’ve unleashed a lot of confusion out there, and for which I deeply apologize.”</p><p>The 2024 Met Gala celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute’s “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibit.</p><p>“The idea of ‘Sleeping Beauties’ is taking these masterpieces from different periods, and because so many of them are very fragile, they are laid flat behind glass walls,” Wintour shared.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While with Bush Hager at the Costume Institute’s restoration label, Wintour couldn’t help but acknowledge this year’s A-list lineup of Met Gala co-chairs.</p><p>“We have <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong>. I believe this will be her 14th visit to the Costume Institute opening,” she said, adding that co-chair <strong>Bad Bunny</strong> is “such an extraordinary lover of costume and fashion.”</p><p>Wintour noted that co-chair <strong>Zendaya</strong> “will not disappoint” with her ensemble, before adding that no one would “be a better prince than <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong> to wake the sleeping beauties.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6Weri1za2mrqpdl66vusSdZJydoqmuqrqMn6aonKNis7O7zGaroZ1dorK1ecaao5plnZq7tnnSnpxmr5iesKl7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
