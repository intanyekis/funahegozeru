Valentine in October, where she detailed an altercation that many believed to be about Marí.</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“When you’re a performer, we know how important it is to give love to other performers — especially when you happen to be sitting on the front row at their show,” she said. “I remember this I don’t wanna be here energy.</p><p>“She was with a gentleman, she was his guest. I know the guy very well. She didn’t wanna be there. It was very obvious. I felt disrespected by that. So when they came to my dressing room backstage, I said something and we almost got to scrapping. It could have got real ugly.”</p><p>Despite not specifically naming the artist in question, Hilson described her as “pretty insignificant at this point.”</p><p></p><p>Teairra Marí later responded to Keri Hilson’s comments on Instagram, where she challenged her to fight and threatened to “whoop” her ass.</p><p>“Y’all, people gotta leave me alone. I don’t bother anybody. Just leave me the fuck alone,” she wrote. “So, Keri. What’s up, you wanna fight or do you not want to fight because I’m gonna whoop your ass when I see you I’m sick of you people bothering me! You had a whole different story when I was in your face you’re a liar bitch!!!”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Hilson then responded to Marí in an Instagram comment of her own, writing: “Well fellas, I guess the ‘I ain’t sayin no names’ segment didn’t work too well this time… Unfortunately this did happen around 12-13 years ago. I never knew until I saw the previous post you also told this story publicly.</p><p>“Listen… we were very young in our careers and I was remembering how I felt when it happened. But I don’t feel a way about this situation now. Since then, we’ve run into each other, apologized, partied together & gotten past that.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/keri-hilson-says-she-ready-to-return-to-music-after-years-of-struggle-250x142.jpeg alt="Keri Hilson ‘Ready’ To Return To Music After ‘Years Of Struggle’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Keri Hilson ‘Ready’ To Return To Music After ‘Years Of Struggle’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 19, 2023</p></a><p>Hilson went on to apologize to Marí: “I’m responding to this because I don’t wanna allow anything to bring us back to a place we’ve long passed. And since it was a public story that got connected to you in public, it deserves a public apology. I’m sorry for telling the story especially with the energy & hurtful words that I used.</p><p>“It was unnecessary. Because my feelings and energy at this point, in this present moment are nothing but love… no ill will or vitriol towards you. It’s an old story that I see now we’ve both told. I hope you’re doing well in this season & wishing you all the best in life.”</p><p>Marí has yet to respond to Hilson’s apology.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirnpmZp7%2BiecyaqaJlm5q%2FqnnHoqOsp55is6qzx61km52Vmw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
