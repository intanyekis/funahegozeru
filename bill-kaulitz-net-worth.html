In addition to singing, Kaulitz has also voice acted the German version of “Arthur and the Invisibles”. At the age of 10, he and his brother Tom began performing on stage in live shows in Magdeburg. They performed a few small shows. Though they were unknown, the audience loved their performances.</p><p>Tokio Hotel started their debut visit in Germany to promote the release of Schrei and its singles. They also recorded a live DVD of the performances. Kaulitz became popular on stage due to his excessive oomph and fashion and the ability to harmonize with the audience. Tokio Hotel became a household name in Germany during this time. They were thus motivated to return to the studio for further recordings. After the huge success of Schrei, Kaulitz’s band Tokio Hotel started working on their next album named Zimmer 483. Tokio Hotel's fan-club grew – many such clubs opened in the West. They decided to re-record selected songs from their two most popular albums – Schrei and Zimmer 483 in English. The result was the release of the new album - Scream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bill Kaulitz was born on 1st September 1989 in Leipzig, Germany.
