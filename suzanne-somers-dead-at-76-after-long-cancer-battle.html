I didn’t make a big deal about it. In my 30s, I got a malignant melanoma in my back. People just wanted to protect Chrissy Snow. Creating her was actually intellectual. How do I make her likable and loveable … dumb blondes are annoying. I gave her a moral code. I imagined it was the childhood I would’ve liked to have had.”</p><p>Somers was born the third of four children to&nbsp;Marion and Francis Mahoney, and she often spoke about her difficult&nbsp;childhood.</p><p>“I am a child of an alcoholic… and when you live with violence or addiction or alcoholism of any kind, you handle it one of who ways: you either crumble and just can’t handle it, [or go into crisis mode],” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Somers told Fox News in 2021</a>.</p><p>“When you go into crisis mode, you become very calm. You assess the situation and try to calm it all down.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Somers in The New York Post studio in 2020. <span class=credit>Brian Zak/NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Somers got her big break as Chrissy Snow in “Three’s Company.” <span class=credit>Bettmann Archive</span></figure><p>She had bit roles in the ’70s, including in 1973’s “American Graffiti” and on “The Rockford Files” and “The Six Million Dollar Man.”</p><p>She landed her breakout role as the giggly, short-shorts-clad Chrissy — one of two women living with Jack Tripper (played by&nbsp;John Ritter), a goofy guy who pretends to be gay to appease their landlord — on “Three’s Company.”</p><p>The show premiered on ABC in&nbsp;1977. Somers eventually saw her role diminished amid contract disputes.</p><p>“I got fired from ‘Three’s Company’ for having the audacity to ask to be paid commensurate with men. They were making 10 to 15 times more and John [Ritter] was making much more than me,” Somers told CBS News.</p><p>“They had designated John the star, as my star rose and started competing with John’s star, it made them mad at me. It made them mad when I was on every magazine cover and John wasn’t. We were all on the cover of Newsweek. That was a fiasco that day. The producers didn’t tell any of us that Newsweek wanted to feature just Chrissy and nobody told me either.”</p><p>She exited the show in the 1980 season and&nbsp;appeared in two Playboy&nbsp;cover-feature nude pictorials in the ’80s.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Hamel and Somers attend the 30th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Gala at the Palm Springs Convention Center on Jan. 3, 2019. <span class=credit>Patrick McMullan via Getty Image</span></figure><p>She made her big return to network TV&nbsp;opposite Patrick Duffy in “Step by Step,” a sitcom about blended families that aired from 1991 to 1998.</p><p>She also&nbsp;co-hosted “Candid Camera,”&nbsp;led the Lifetime talk show “The Suzanne Show”&nbsp;in 2012, and competed on “Dancing with the Stars”&nbsp;in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Somers and Hamel&nbsp;tied the&nbsp;knot&nbsp;in 1977.
