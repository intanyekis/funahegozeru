That’s when she discovered the virus was likely replicating in her blood.</p><p>On Thursday, to mark the National Day of Women Living with HIV, the 28-year-old revisited those awful early moments.</p><p>She told the ABC that five years ago, shortly after starting a new relationship, she felt unlike her normal healthy self.</p><p>“I had recently started a new relationship so I got a sexual health screen,” she said.</p><p>“I was given some anti-viral for the cold sores and it came back all clear. Everything was negative.”</p><p>Her doctor, she says, told her “You’re an Australian woman” and she shouldn’t worry. When she insisted on an HIV test, she remembers clearly the look on her doctor’s face.</p><p>“I told her what the guy had said so she ordered the test and I got a call back about three days later asking me to come back in,” Ms Landy told news.com.au.</p><p>“I was still really crook at this point and the doctor was really visibly distressed. She said, ‘I’m so sorry but it looks like you’ve contracted HIV’.</p><p>“I saw a specialist and he laid down the facts. I said, ‘When am I dying? When does this mean?’ I had no idea of what it meant to have HIV in 2012. I assumed it was game over.</p><p>“He said, ‘Look, it’s a really manageable chronic illness. You take a couple of pills a day. People live next to normal lives’. And that’s when I thought, ‘OK, life does continue’.”</p><p>Ms Landy is telling her story because her doctor’s failure to diagnose HIV in women is so common.</p><p>According to the National Association of People with HIV Australia, the test for HIV is often overlooked. AIDS Action Council’s Philippa Moss <a class=body-link href=#>told the ABC stigma is part of the reason</a>.</p><p>“Women are far too often silenced, and their experiences are unrecognised and unaddressed because women don’t meet the stereotype of the so-called typical person who’s going to contract HIV,” Ms Moss said.</p><p>“HIV is seen to be a gay man’s disease, when in fact it’s not.”</p><p>It’s a message echoed by Ms Landy who says she knows of a number of women who are discriminated against because they contracted the virus.</p><p>“People assume ‘If you’re not black or a gay man then you must be a slut’,” she told news.com.au.</p><p>“But I think the reason I have avoided a lot of the discrimination a lot of people with HIV and AIDS face is because I’m really open about it. I’m really unapologetic. I’m not ashamed. It is what it is. I think the way you present it goes a long way to how people will react to you.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.news.com.au/wp-content/themes/newscorpau-news-dna/dist/images/icons/blank-square.svg width=1280 height=720 alt="Why Is HIV Prevention Drug Not in Widespread Use?" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bhtqex0q2wpZ1fnbKiuNOhZqGdkaHBqXnPq6abpJWiwHC%2F2J2lnrFdrLyurc1mrqGnXZy8sLPLnptmoJmreqW10pymr52imrFuv8eeZKGZlGKurbiMrZ%2BeZaOuurHAzqaqaKaVrMBuv9OoqbJnYm1%2FdYSQn5qcbJKag6avkJ2YbJuSZ4V3rpdyb25sZmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
