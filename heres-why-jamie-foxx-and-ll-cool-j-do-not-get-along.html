The two have had extraordinary careers in both film, television, and music. While their talents as individuals reigned throughout the 90s, it was their time together on the set of the hit 1999 film, 'Any Given Sunday', that had their relationship start on a bad note!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the filming of the film, a scene involving a fight between LL Cool J and Jamie Foxx's character, led to a real-life brawl between the two.&nbsp;While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Pacino </a>and Dennis Quaid, who also appears in the film, claim the fight was over before it even began, it seems as if it led to quite the feud between the iconic duo.

The star released his debut single, 'I Need A Beat', back in 1984, and essentially revolutionized the rap game as we know it. The 80s and 90s was quite the time for breakout stars, including Jamie Foxx, who got his big break on the 1990 comedy, 'In Living Color'. The actor quickly came to prominence, and secured himself his very own sitcom, 'The Jamie Foxx Show'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Jamie and LL Cool J were amongst the most popular stars of the 90s, therefore, it was only fitting that the two would make a great team in the 1999 film, 'Any Given Sunday'. The film not only starred these to leading actors, but also Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, and Cameron Diaz, to name a few. While the film production was well underway, a scene involving Jamie and LL Cool J's character took a turn for the worst!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>LL Cool J Jabs At Current Artists, Claiming He Paved The Way For Them</a></span></p><p>After&nbsp;having issues regarding aggressiveness in several scenes, Jamie allegedly asked LL Cool J to ease up, however, when the time came for their fight scene, it appears as if Jamie went off-script and punched LL in the face! "So, we did another take ... And, then, I don't know, but he thought it was a good idea to punch me in my face. This wasn't scripted", LL Cool J said during his BET interview. It didn't take much time before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LL retaliated by quite literally knocking Jamie Foxx out!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dennis Quaid, who had left the set at the time, heard the commotion happen, and rushed back to see Jamie on the floor. The fight had ended before Dennis could even make it back on time, claiming that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it all came down to their "egos"</a>. Although the two were at odds for years after their off-screen altercation, the two have made amends and share quite a special friendship today.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Are Jamie Foxx And Howard Stern Still Feuding?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoZqlmZp6p7vXsWSappRiua15wqimpWWaYrGwec2oq2aflal6orjOp55o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
