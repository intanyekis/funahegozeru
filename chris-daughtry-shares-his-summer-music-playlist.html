It makes have this sense of driving with the rooftop down, with your hair blowing in the wind. Obviously, I do remember what that was like when I had hair!”</p><p><strong>“Summer of ’69” by Bryan Adams</strong><br>“Even though I was born in ’79, 10 years later, because of the immortal words of Bryan Adams, I feel like I know a little bit about the ’60s. I know that Jimmy quit the band, Jody got married. He just took us through a period of his life and really painted a picture.”</p><p><strong>“Summertime Sadness” by Lana del Rey</strong><br>“Actually, every Lana Del Rey song reminds me of the summer, but this one has the word summer in it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chris-daughtry.jpg><p><strong>“Cool for the Summer” by Demi Lovato</strong><br>“I love that song. I hope she’s doing well. I hope you’re doing well, Demi.”</p><p><strong>“September” by Daughtry</strong><br>“I have to be a little self-indulgent here just because it’s such a personal song to me. It always brings up memories of being a kid, playing out in the rain in the summertime. It’s probably one of my favorite songs I’ve written.”</p><p><strong>“Endless Summer Nights” by Richard Marx</strong><br>“If you were around in the ’80s, you can’t not think of that song. I remember the video on MTV. It just always brings me back to my childhood.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>“In the Air Tonight” by Phil Collins</strong><br>“I never really thought of this song as a summer song until I saw it in The Hangover, which I saw in the summertime. It always brings me back.”</p><p>“Summertime” by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince<br>“You can’t not have that. IT should have been No. 1, actually!”</p><p>His rock band, Daughtry, recently released their alum Cage to Battle, out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoeqWt1KCfraqpYsCprdGeqmagmah6tMHMppyrZZ2qwKqvjKmjmrGcnsC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
