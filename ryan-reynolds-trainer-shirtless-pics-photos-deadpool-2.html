Don’s post included two photos of a standing and smiling Ryan showing off his six pack muscles while wearing green pants over <strong>Calvin Klein</strong> underwear that was sticking out over the top of the hem. In the caption, he revealed the photos were taken while he was helping Ryan prepare to film his 2018 movie Deadpool 2 and also promoted a podcast. “Here is a never before seen pic of @vancityreynolds&nbsp;during his prep for&nbsp;@deadpoolmovie 2. This guy keeps getting better every year!😉 To listen to the ‘How to look like a Superhero’ Podcast swipe up in my stories. Thank you @slate for having me on,” the caption read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It didn’t take long for fans to react to Don’s post and they naturally had a lot of positive comments. “My dream shape,” one comment read. “Oh my my my,” another read. “This guy is literally the reason I started working out. 💪” a third response read. Other followers just posted simple heart-eyed emojis and/or hearts, proving the photos made quite the impression.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Ryan’s not preparing for movies and looking amazing, he’s spending time with his family. The father-of-two is getting ready to welcome a third child with wife<strong> Blake Lively</strong>, 32, and he recently took to Instagram to share the joy by posting Blake’s baby bump in honor of her birthday on Aug. 25.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Don’s latest pics of Ryan definitely didn’t disappoint fans!
