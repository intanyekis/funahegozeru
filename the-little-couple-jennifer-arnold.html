Even though the pair officially met at a online dating site, they were both patients of Dr. Kopits and came across each other at the age of 10. The pair tied the knot on April 12, 2008, at St. Mary’s downtown. They adopted two children from overseas, both of whom have dwarfism as well. Their son William&nbsp;Rejin was born in China in 2010, and their daughter Zoey was born in India in 2011.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9>Health Issues Over the Years</h2><p><strong>Cancer</strong>: In 2013, Jennifer was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that develops from the cells that form the placenta during pregnancy. Jennifer had suffered a miscarriage earlier that year, which triggered the cancer. She underwent intensive chemotherapy for several months and lost her hair as a result. She also had to put her plans to adopt Zoey from India on hold until she was cleared by her doctors. Fortunately, Jennifer was declared cancer-free in 2014 and was able to travel to India to meet her daughter for the first time.&nbsp;She has since been in remission and has been vocal about raising awareness and funds for cancer research.</p><p><strong>Cardiac Arrhythmia</strong>: In 2021, Jennifer revealed that her mother had been admitted to the hospital for urgent cardiac tests after experiencing spontaneous bleeding from her nose. The doctors suspected that she had a cardiac arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. Jennifer urged her fans to seek medical attention for any non-COVID-19 related symptoms and to take care of their heart health. She later updated that her mother did not have any signs of cancer or tumors, but rather some sort of sinus infection or disease.</p><p><strong>Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Type Strudwick (SED)</strong>: Jennifer was born with SED, a rare genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the bones and cartilage.

Jennifer has undergone more than 30 surgeries throughout her life to correct various issues caused by SED, such as scoliosis, hip dysplasia, leg length discrepancy, and spinal compression.
