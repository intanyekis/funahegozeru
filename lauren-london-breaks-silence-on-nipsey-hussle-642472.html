I’ve lost my best friend,” the grieving actress wrote on Instagram Tuesday (April 2).</p><p>“My sanctuary. My protector. My soul…I’m lost without you. We are lost without you babe. I have no words.”</p><p>The 33-year-old rapper was shot and killed outside of his Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles, on March 31. The suspected shooter, 29-year-old Eric Holder, <a href=# rel=noopener>was arrested</a> in Bellflower, California on Tuesday (April 2), hours after the LAPD tweeted a photo of him asking for the public’s help to track him down.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Blast</a>, Nipsey’s body was picked up from the Los Angeles County coroners office and transported to Angelus Funeral Home in Los Angeles Tuesday. The mortuary became the first black-owned incorporated business in California in 1925, as noted by the website.</p><p>London and Nipsey, whose birth name was Ermias Asghedom, had reportedly been dating since 2013 and share a toddler son (in addition to London’s son from a previous relationship and Nipsey’s daughter from a previous relationship). The pair recently opened up about their relationship in a spread for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">GQ magazine</a> alongside a gorgeous photo shoot in Los Angeles. Nipsey was particularly struck by London’s dedication to their family detailing her decision to pass on a role because she was pregnant with their son. “Lauren was handpicked by John Singleton to do&nbsp;Snowfall. She read, got the part, shot the pilot…did stunts…this was her dream role,” he recalled. “And then she got pregnant with our son. That was a really hard decision for her to make.”</p><p>“I didn’t put any pressure on her for whatever decision she wanted to make,” he continued. “I learned then that what she believes in, she really believes in.”</p><p>“Do I choose my soul or myself?” added London. “I went with my soul.”</p><p>See London’s emotional post about Nipsey’s death below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Gutr7Ep2Slp56ZvK95waucmqOjYsCquMSnmp5ln6N6r7XPrJyyZZiqwLS4xGZtbWpkbH9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
