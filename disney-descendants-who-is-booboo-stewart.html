Sure, celebrities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dove Cameron have their breakups chronicled by the media</a>, and fans across the globe mourned Cameron Boyce when the 'Jessie' star passed away in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But other Disney faces — like Booboo — mostly fly under the radar. Even the actress behind Uma earned notoriety for being a villain-turned-hero that children everywhere could look up to.</p><p>What about Booboo, AKA Jay, the son of Jafar, from 'Descendants'?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Disney 'Descendants' Star China Anne McClain Doing Now?</a></span></p><p>Stewart actually started his career back in the early 2000s, but it was his early roles on 'Twilight' that really earned him attention in the media. He was nominated for a Razzie because of 'Twilight,' in which he played a werewolf alongside Taylor Lautner.</p><p>But Booboo — or Nils Allen Stewart Jr. — had countless other roles before the vampire flick, too. They were mostly independent or TV films, but the experiences were varied; Booboo did everything from stunt work to singing to hip-hop dance and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's also worked with tons of big names in the industry: Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, and more. Oh, and Booboo toured with Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, back in the 'Hannah Montana' era.</p><p>One of the most impressive parts of Booboo's career, clearly, is his musical talent. Fans of the 'Descendants' franchise will remember that all four of the main stars (and countless other cast members) had to learn tons of dance steps, sing original songs, and even do some minor stunts.</p><p>Stewart's musical background clearly helped him out on the Disney set, and he hasn't stopped dabbling in music since. Actually, dabbling isn't even the right word -- Booboo's Wikipedia page notes that he's a visual artist, actor, and singer, and he's been busy since 'Descendants 3.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only has he been making music (along with a friend as the group That Band Honey), creating art, and practicing karate, but he's also been bingeing 'The Bachelor' with his girlfriend, Valentina Cy.</p><p>The 27-year-old clearly isn't done acting yet, either, and his most recent gig was in 'Let Him Go,' a film with Kevin Costner. He hasn't strayed too far from Disney in some ways, though; he's voice acted on 'Big City Greens' recently, and provided a cameo on 'Robot Chicken.'</p><p>But one of the most interesting things about Booboo is probably his background. Fans realize that he's played a ton of diverse roles — Jay was Jafar's son, so the character was probably meant to be Arabic. But Stewart has also portrayed Asian, Hawaiian, Native American, and other characters in movies and on TV shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe it's fitting, though;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey Magazine</a> confirmed that Stewart's family background is a blend of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Scottish, and Blackfoot Native American.
