Like most hosts of an awards show, he jabbed at Taylor. He said, “be careful of dating these girls, because they’ll write a song about you!” They camera then panned to Taylor who laughed and nodded her head. At least she was a good sport about it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Then Tracy went on to say if a guy even forgets to open a car door for Taylor, she’ll write about it! That’s not necessarily true, but we think it was definitely funny.</p><h3>Tracy Admits He’ll Make Fun Of Certain Celebs</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tracy spoke about hosting the show a few days before the big day and he said he wasn’t nervous at all.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“If I say, ‘I’m nervous,’ then I’m going to be nervous,” he said. “If I’m excited, then I can’t wait for it to start. People who are nervous can’t wait for it to be over. Nervousness is negative to me. Excitement is the way I like to use it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>When asked who he was going to make fun of, he said: “Some people are going to be in the line of fire.” That couldn’t have ended up being more true.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I’m not looking forward to making fun of anybody, because these are all the best of the best in the world,” he said. “I’m just going to be excited to be there.”</p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tracy Morgan Makes Fun Of Taylor Swift At The Billboard Music Awards</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>— Chloe Melas</strong></p><h3>More Billboard Music Awards News:</h3><li>Billboard Music Awards Live Stream — Watch The Blue Carpet Online</li><li>Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez Are Sitting Together At Billboard Awards</li><li>Justin Bieber: Smart Move To Sing To Selena Gomez At Billboard Awards</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH12e5ByZq2qkZjGbrnOq56apl2Xtq24waiYq5xdlsSivsOsZKGno6l6c3yQbGSbmp2WfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
