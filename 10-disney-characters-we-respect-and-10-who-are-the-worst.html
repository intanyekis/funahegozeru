Yes, there are the faves… along with the characters who do mean things, who mess things up and who get on fans’ nerves. And all of these are going to be discussed, right here and right now.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On one hand, there are smart, attractive, inspiring and memorable characters, and fans admire them, have crushes on them, learn from them and enjoy them. On the other hand, there are annoying, not-so-smart, selfish and irritating characters, and fans get so frustrated with their parts in these classic tales. However, their parts are necessary, as they create conflict and lead to the success of stars! That being said, it is time to go over some really great people from this magical brand, as well as some not-so-great ones, too.&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=respect-belle><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Respect: Belle</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gallery_princess_belle_2_f4a938c0.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Belle, from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Beauty and the Beast, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>is one of the most brilliant and beautiful princesses out there.
