Another <a href=#>listing </a>is selling the cookies for $29.99 each but is offering slight discounts for buying multiple boxes and free shipping. A recent <a href=#>listing </a>had four boxes available for $40 each in a Buy It Now sale, including free shipping.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Some listings as of Monday morning were closer to the price the Girl Scouts sold them for — about $5 — but they were regular eBay <a href=#>auctions</a>, not a Buy It Now offer, which could make the price balloon the closer it gets to the auctions’ closings.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">But Girl Scouts of the USA said it was “disappointed” that the cookies were being sold through other vendors, <a href=#>CNN </a>reported. The organization said the money is being taken from troops’ profits.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“When cookies are purchased through a third-party seller, Girl Scout troops are deprived of proceeds that fund critical programming throughout the year,” Girl Scouts officials told <a href=#>CNN </a>and the “<a href=#>Today</a>” show in statements.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Girl Scouts of the USA said the only authorized locations consumers should buy the coveted cookies are either in person or online through a local troop.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Girl Scouts of the USA, your local Girl Scout council, and our licensed cookie bakers cannot guarantee the freshness or integrity of cookies bought through unauthorized sites,” the organization told “<a href=#>Today</a>.” “In many instances, these cookies are expired, or the sellers are using Girl Scouts’ intellectual property without permission. We encourage everyone interested in purchasing Girl Scout Cookies to visit <a href=#>www.girlscoutcookies.org</a> to connect with Girl Scouts in your community.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Officials with eBay said the listings will remain, despite saying the company supports scouting.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“We strongly support the entrepreneurial spirit of hardworking local Girl Scout troops and encourage cookie-seekers to also support their local Girl Scouts,” eBay said in a statement to <a href=#>CNN</a>. “However the sale of Girl Scout cookies does not violate eBay policies.”</p><p>Latest trending news:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZpynn6C2pnnCq6ymmpyawG6%2BwKynm52ip8ZuvsClo7Jll56%2FrXnSnKaurF2YvLC3yJ6qZqufobFuscGasGhuf2mck6CgkHt%2FgGeJm5mbtYiEiHljhpaIoY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
