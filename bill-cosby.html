Bill began his career as a stand-up in the 1960s after leaving Temple University. His first big break came when he appeared on&nbsp;The Tonight Show in 1963, and released his first stand-up album in 1964. Bill’s comedy was family-oriented and family-friendly; a huge diversion from the more raunchy style of comedy at the time.&nbsp;In 1965, he became the first black actor to co-star in a drama for his role in&nbsp;I Spy, for which he has won three Emmys. In 1969, Bill developed&nbsp;The Bill Cosby Show for NBC, a sitcom, which ran for two seasons. His Saturday morning cartoon show&nbsp;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids was a little more successful; it ran from 1972 to 1979.&nbsp;The Cosby Show, which debuted in 1985, was easily the project which marked Bill’s name in history; it is currently the highest-ranking sitcom of all time.&nbsp;After <i>The Cosby Show</i>, Bill would go on to a number of film and television roles and hosting gigs. His TV and film appearances gradually tapered as he aged, but he&nbsp;continues to record stand-up. His most recent album,&nbsp;Bill Cosby: Far From Finished, was released in 2012 when he was 76 years old.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Bill is best known for his stand-up and for creating The Cosby Show, which debuted in 1985 and ran for 8 seasons and 202 episodes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Bill met wife <strong>Camilla Olivia Hanks</strong> while performing stand-up in Washington, D.C. in the 1960s. They married in 1964, and had five children (<strong>Erika Ranee</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Erinn Charlene</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ensa Camille</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Evin Harrah</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Ennis William</strong>); Ennis was tragically murdered in 1997.&nbsp;Bill had a relationship out of wedlock with a woman named <b>Shawn Upshaw</b> in the 1970s; in 1997, he testified that he had made private payments to her. Shawn alleged that her daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Autumn Jackson</strong>, was his; when Autumn tried to extort Bill for $50 million in 1999, she was sentenced to 26 months in prison.&nbsp;Bill has been the target of many accusations of sexual assault; in Nov. 2006, he settled out of court with a Canadian woman who claimed that he drugged and sexually assaulted her. He has been accused by over 46&nbsp;separate women of similar crimes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yjtculZJyno5fGcIOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
