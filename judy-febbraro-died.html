She was the cafeteria manager there for a really long time, helping to make sure students had good food to eat. <strong>After working for almost 40 years at Oakland Catholic and another school called Saint Paul Cathedral High School</strong>, Judy decided to stop working and enjoy her retirement in June of last year. She was also married to Carmelo, and they were very close. <strong>Judy loved the girls’ basketball team a lot and always cheered for them.</strong> People who knew her say she was very kind and always thought about others before herself. She had a friendly nature and was nice to all the students and the school staff. Judy was also known for baking really tasty cookies that could make anyone’s day brighter with a smile.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Judy_Febbraro_Died_What_Was_Her_Cause_of_Death></span>Judy Febbraro Died: What Was Her Cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Judy Febbraro, who was 76 years old, sadly passed away in her own home.

Judy retired this past June after serving OC and Saint Paul Cathedral High School for about 40 years.</strong></p><p><strong>She was dearly loved by the thousands of students she served. She will be remembered for her cookies, easy laughter, and love for the OC girls. The entire Oakland Catholic community will miss Judy.</strong></p><p><strong>Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon her. May the soul of the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.</strong></p><strong>– Wrote by Oakland Catholic High School</strong><p><strong>Read this also: <a href=#>Freeman Wade Died: Know Everything About His Death</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Special_Mass_for_Judy></span>A Special Mass for Judy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Judy was a kind and thoughtful friend who always cared about others more than herself. On Sunday, between 1 and 6 p.m., people can come to the office of John A. Freyvogel Sons, Inc. at 4900 Center Avenue, near Devonshire Street, to meet and remember Judy. Then, on Monday, there will be a special Mass at 10 a.m. in St. Raphael Church at St. Jude Parish. After that, Judy will be laid to rest at Mt. Royal Cemetery. Judy’s strong belief in her Catholic faith never wavered.</p><p>Instead of sending flowers, Judy’s family asks that if you want to help, you can give donations to the Catholic Church in Oakland.
