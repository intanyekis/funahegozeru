According to White, McMahon wanted to have the match at Wrestlemania XXVII in Atlanta, but White declined the invitation.</p><p>"Vince wanted to fight me. Swear to God. Called me up and said, "Let's do it." We can either do it in the UFC, or let's do it at WrestleMania. And I said, "You are crazy."</p><p>"I always have said it, and I'll say it again; I respect Vince very much. But Vince is too old to be fighting anybody."</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpVybGlrXaq9pa3TnptmoZ6bvLO5wK2gqKZdpLtuvsSppquslZl6pLmMqayno12eu6vB0bJknZmelnq4tMitnGarka7AbsLIp5qeZZ2YuqK0zqdksJmeqbKledOoZJ%2Bhl53BbrTIpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
