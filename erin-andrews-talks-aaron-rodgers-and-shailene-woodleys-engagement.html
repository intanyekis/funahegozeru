Wow, he really did,” she told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. “There [were] rumors, I think, that they were dating, but yeah. I had no idea, and then he unveiled it in his MVP speech. So, [he] surprised everybody. Really kept that quiet.”</p><p></p><p>Rodgers, 37, revealed he was engaged to the Big Little Lies actress, 29, on February 6 <a href=#>during a speech at the 2021 NFL Honors awards</a>.

The relationship is long-distance for right now, but they are making it work.”</p><p>The Secret Life of the American Teenager actress <a href=#>confirmed the engagement</a> during a February 22 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, offering fans a peek at her large engagement ring.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I never thought I’d be engaged [to] somebody who threw balls for a living,” the&nbsp;activist joked. Though she didn’t offer a specific timeline, she did let it slip that the couple had been engaged for a while.</p><p>“We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar,” Woodley explained. “When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn’t know like what kind of a football guy he was. And I’m still constantly learning.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaeqpmjeqK6w6ucsKtdqa6tt9JmmJqqn6N6s7vDoJyrq12Wu6V50qGYoqSVo7Juw86om6Wdqah6prrGmp6epZWjwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
