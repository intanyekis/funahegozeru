In&nbsp;1988, he started working for his father's shipping company, the Troodos Shipping Co Ltd. Four years later, he received a total of&nbsp;Â£30 million which he used to put up his own company, the Stelmar Shipping. In 2001, the company went public and by 2005, he sold the company for a price which quadruples its initial share price.
