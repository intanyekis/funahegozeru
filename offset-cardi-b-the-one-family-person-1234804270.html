The Atlanta rapper shared that he and Cardi both share the same family values that they’ve instilled in their own family structure. The couple shares two children — Kulture and Wave, as the former Migos rapper also has three other children from a previous relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“First off, she’s a family person. F**K the music and all that sh*t,” he said. “That sh*t never mattered — that’s not what I look at. I look at your home values because I’m from the South, so I’m raised by my mother and grandmother. I come from strong women and I see how dedicated and determined she was to get to a certain place for her family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=686752>the “Up” rhymer</a> working hard to overcome obstacles and heighten her success, he added, “She comes from the bottom, from stripping, and she was still helping the family with that little money. It’s [also] her grind and her focus. You can’t tell her nothing and it’s the same way with me. There’s nothing you can tell me I can’t do at all. I don’t care what you think. It’s that determination.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although the “Fan” rapper has faced<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234783026> infidelities in the past</a> with Cardi, he revealed how the couple has mended their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1516637918.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“First off by, like, respecting her position, right? We both public figures, we both in the eyes of people,” he said of his own revelations. “Stop being selfish. You’re married to this woman, be dedicated to this woman,” he said of how they rebuilt trust. “Also, just being more communicative about sh*t. Like, we just talk more.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He went on, “Cause you know work was getting in the way sometimes and it was like [phew] and we would talk all the time but like communication is key man. If you don’t like some sh*t, tell me, and if I don’t like some sh*t I’ll tell you. We talk and communication is key, not communicating f**ks sh*t up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cardi just <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234801836>celebrated her 31st birthday</a> on Oct. 12, which her husband made extra special for her. The&nbsp;<a href=#>“Jealousy” rapper</a>&nbsp;shared a carousel of images and videos of her wearing a skin-tight laced red dressed while surrounded by red roses and balloons — courtesy of Set.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A month prior, Set <a href=# data-type=post data-id=607248>celebrated their anniversary</a> with a sweet post about how his wife has helped him to “become a better man.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Happy anniversary my beautiful Gorgeous Pretty Wife,” he wrote on Instagram. “Since I met you I grown to become a better man no matter what you have my back and I can trust you with my life blessed to have a loyal strong woman on my side…you blessed me with beautiful kids you are my safe place in this crazy world.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “You believe in me more than I do sometimes… I couldn’t imagine a life without you….. we gone continue life together I LOVE YOU.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Szp7%2FErWScmaKZtm6ujK2fnmWfo7JussCmoKWxXaWys7%2FOp2RqamNphXGAkXBnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
