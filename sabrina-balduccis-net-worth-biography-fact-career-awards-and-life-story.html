On the day of the wedding, the limo driver was running late, prompting Charlie to threaten the limo driver, “I will gut you like the f–king piece of s–t you are. I’ll hunt you down like f–king cattle.”</p><p>In an interview with 20/20, Balducci said: “In defense of myself, I really did what any Staten Islander would have done in that situation.”</p><p>His wife said, “Picture somebody in your house, following you at every event you did, every place you went, for four months. You’ve got a newborn baby, you’re trying to plan a wedding.”</p><p>Balducci concluded, “She had her freak-outs, too. It’s just that my freak-out trumped everything else.”</p><p>Charlie was the president and founder of NYC Arts Cypher, a non-profit arts organization that promotes positive values through arts and entertainment programs, projects, and events.</p><p>Balducci dedicated his life to promoting art on the borough, founding the nonprofit organization NYC Arts Cypher in 2006.
