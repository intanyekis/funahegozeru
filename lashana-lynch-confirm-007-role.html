Daniel Craig will make his last appearance as James Bond and will be stepping down after a 15-year run as the British spy and there are suggestions his character will meet his demise in the film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Previously:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="James Bond Actor Sean Connery Dies At 90" href=#>James Bond Actor Sean Connery Dies At 90</a></span></p><p>Craig had previously indicated his desire to step away and, last month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offered advice to whoever succeeds him</a>. As it turns out, Lynch will be taking on the challenge, which she expects to be difficult given that she's a black woman.</p><p>The 32-year-old actress spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a>'s&nbsp;Yrsa Daley-Ward in a recent interview which confirms rumors from last year suggesting she would be the one to become 007 in the wake of Craig's departure, also noting the abuse she's been getting on social media is not something she can take personally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I am one Black woman – if it were another Black woman cast in the role, it would have been the same conversation, she would have got the same attacks, the same abuse," she said. "I just have to remind myself that the conversation is happening and that I’m a part of something that will be very, very revolutionary.</p><p>"I feel very grateful that I get to challenge those narratives. We’re moving away from toxic masculinity, and that’s happening because women are being open, demanding and vocal, and calling out misbehavior as soon as we see it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No Time To Die was delayed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is now penciled in for an April 2021 release. Lynch's appearance as Nomi in the latest trailer depicts an agent equal to Bond in skill and wit. There are also hints of Bond being betrayed by someone close, who could turn out to be Nomi - although the traitor is really thought to be either Madeline Swann or Paloma.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Daniel Craig's Bike Stunt In No Time To Die Used Up $70K Just For Coca-Cola" href=#>Daniel Craig's Bike Stunt In No Time To Die Used Up $70K Just For Coca-Cola</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8uaqqGZnpZ6rcXNnJ9mm5%2Bjs6q%2BzGZnaW9dp7ytsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
