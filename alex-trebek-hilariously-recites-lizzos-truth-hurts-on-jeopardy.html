Yeah.”</p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yq5LE1HfOU</a></p><p>— Emily Smith (@EmilySmithCNN) <a href=#>March 27, 2020</a></p><p>Lizzo celebrated the first time she was the answer to a Jeopardy! clue in October 2019. “IM A @jeopardy QUESTION MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I MADE IT I LOVE YOU ALEX TREBEK,” <a href=# rel>she wrote via Instagram</a> at the time.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trebek has received plenty of support</a> since he revealed he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer </a>in March 2019. The Canada native shared that he hoped to “beat the low survival rate” and that he planned to continue to host Jeopardy! as long as he is physically able.</p><p>One year later, Trebek gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an update on his health </a>and explained that the past few months haven’t been easy for him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There were moments of great pain, days when certain bodily functions no longer functioned, and sudden massive attacks of great depression that made me wonder if it really was worth fighting on,” he said in a YouTube video posted on March 4. “But I brushed that aside quickly because that would have been a massive betrayal — a betrayal of my wife and soulmate, Jean, who has given her all to help me survive. It would have been a betrayal of other cancer patients who have looked to me as an inspiration and a cheerleader of sorts of the value of living and hope. And it would certainly have been a betrayal of my faith in God and the millions of prayers that had been said on my behalf.”</p><p>During an ABC special in January, Trebek explained that he already knew how he would close out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his final broadcast</a> of the game show.</p><p>“I will say my goodbyes and I will tell people: ‘Don’t ask me who’s going to replace me because I have no say whatsoever,'” Trebek said at the time. “‘But I’m sure that if you give them the same love and attention and respect that you have shown me, then they will be a success and the show will continue being a success. And until we meet again, God bless you and goodbye.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJWterW%2BxJucpGWYnrmivsiorKykqWK%2Fpq%2FIrZysZZyex7u70marq62knXqpwdGtqmannmK3prvPmqmdsV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
