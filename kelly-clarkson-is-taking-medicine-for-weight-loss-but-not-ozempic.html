It’s, like, crazy every time you walk in!”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“First of all, it’s all the weight I’ve lost,” Goldberg, 68, responded. “I’ve lost almost two people.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I have lost a lot as well,” Clarkson said, to which Goldberg replied, “I see. I am doing that wonderful shot that works for folks who need some help, and it’s been really good for me.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Mine is a different one that people assume,” Clarkson said, “but I ended up having to do that too because my bloodwork got so bad.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The inaugural <i>American Idol </i>champion added, “My doctor chased me for, like, two years. I was like, ‘No, I’m afraid of it.’ I already have thyroid problems. I was afraid. Everybody thinks it’s Ozempic, but it’s not. It’s something else. But it’s something that aids in helping break down the sugar” because her body “doesn’t do it right.”</span></p><p></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Meanwhile, Ozempic has become a major buzzword in Hollywood circles, with <a href=#>some stars confirming</a> that they’ve used the drug and others denying it. Ozempic, </span><span class=s1>which was created to help with high blood pressure or manage type 2 diabetes, is also being used to lose weight quickly. Doctors, however, have not recommended its use or those of similar drugs like Wegovy or Mounjaro for casual weight loss.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>On Clarkson’s talk show, Goldberg said that she had once weighed 300 pounds.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“My heaviest, I was, like, 203 [pounds], and I’m 5’3″ and a half,” Clarkson said, adding, “It’s funny though because people assumed, ‘Oh, she must have been miserable or depressed or whatever,’ and I was like, ‘No.’ I was not.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Back in January, the “Since U Been Gone” singer revealed on her show </span><span class=s1>that she was <a href=#>diagnosed with prediabetes</a> before losing weight.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kelly-Clarksons-Candid-Quotes-on-Dating-After-Messy-Divorce-WIth-Brandon-Blackstock-4.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Well, I wasn’t shocked,” she said. “I was a tiny bit overweight. But I wasn’t shocked by it. … [T]hey were like, ‘You’re prediabetic. You’re right on the borderline.’ I was like, ‘But I’m not there yet.’”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Clarkson said she waited two years until she finally decided, “OK, I’ll do something about it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>People </i></a>earlier this year that she tends to eat a “healthy mix” of foods. “And 90 percent of the time, I’m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I’m a Texas girl, so I like meat — sorry, vegetarians in the world!”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She also credited her weight loss with living in New York City, where walking is “quite the workout,” and spending time with her kids — daughter River, 9, and son, Remington, 8, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Brandon Blackstock</strong>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaknZyhxm6vy5qppKufo3qqv4ytmKShnpx6rrHDopqippVis7C%2BjLCcop%2BYqXqtu9KsZJutpGK7sMCMqLGepaCesHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
