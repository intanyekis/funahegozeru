With the ongoing pandemic, many of her fans thought that they were some advanced protective&nbsp;masks that can&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;them from catching COVID-19.</p><p style=text-align:justify>These non-evasive LED masks undeniably look like those face shields used by health workers! But this light mask only promises protection from bacteria that cause skin breakouts and other stubborn blemishes.

The changing colors of the mask—red or blue—are caused by varying&nbsp;wavelengths emitted produced by the LED.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:justify>The red light, which is also the longer of them, improves better blood circulation in the face, stimulates collagen to keep the skin firm, and prevents any inflammation.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;the light to count on for anti-aging. The blue light is what kills the bacteria that cause acne and&nbsp;reduces any scarring from harsh breakouts.</p><p style=text-align:justify>There is also the third light called the&nbsp;Amber light which acts as the detoxifier, the master cleaner. It eliminates the waste in the sensitive parts of your skin. It handles the age spots and melasma that are just so difficult to remove. Most importantly, this light helps produce new skin cells to keep you looking fresh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Bizarre But Brilliant Beauty Secrets We’ve Learned From The Kardashians</a></span></p><h2 id=do-led-light-masks-actually-work>Do LED Light Masks Actually Work?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>LED light masks actually work. NYC-Based dermatologists Rita Linker and Dhaval Bhanusali confirm that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these masks do wonders</a>. The only difference between these home light therapy masks&nbsp;and&nbsp;medical-grade&nbsp;light therapy procedures is that the&nbsp;former works at a lower level.</p><p style=text-align:justify>It's not bad for a cheaper alternative though since professional treatments can range from $200-300 per session. But of course, you have to be more responsible in learning how to properly use these LED masks since you won't have a professional to&nbsp;assist you and a technician to set the right amount of light for your treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:justify><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Reveals How She Got Fit After Having Three Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=are-led-masks-dangerous>Are LED Masks Dangerous?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Dermatologist Kavita Mariwalla says that these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LED light masks are safe</a>. This is as long as you pick an FDA-cleared device and protect your eyes from the light. Overexposure to the blue and red lights can damage your eyes&nbsp;and&nbsp;puts those with existing eye-related disorders at a higher risk of experiencing irritations and changes in their vision. These lights can even cause permanent loss of peripheral vision.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kourtney's DMH Aesthetic Led Light Shield Mask's is FDA-approved and&nbsp;is designed to make sure your eyes are safe from the light rays. So you no longer have to buy a separate pair of goggles as advised by most professionals to make sure your eyes are protected.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Ratajkowski Flaunts These Must-Read Self-Improvement Books</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWbpMKzwM2esGajkaexor%2FHopinq12jsrh50qSgp2WTlr%2Bmec6bqp6ro568r3nLnptmpJmctbV5xZqanmWdlsCsedKanZ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
