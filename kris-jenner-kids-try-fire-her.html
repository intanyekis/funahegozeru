However, things aren’t always easy for the businesswoman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a recent interview with WSJ Magazine’s Kristina O’Neill, two of her six children have already <a href=#>tried firing her as their manager</a>.</p><p>In the first season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim Kardashian told her younger sister, Khloe Kardashian that she wants to replace her mom as her manager.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Jenner's Journey To Making Herself & Her Family Multi-Millionaires</a></span></p><p>Kanye West’s ex-wife said that she wants a manager who has an entire team of people. Shortly after the surprising revelation, Khloe decided to rat Kim out to their mom, and Jenner was visibly upset.</p><p>However, everyone who follows the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner clan know that Kim never fired her mom. In fact, Jenner has been Kim’s manager for 14 years.</p><p>The drama, however, didn’t end with Kim. According to Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian also tried to fire her. And there was one time that her eldest daughter tried firing her three times in a day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner never seemed offended by her children’s rash decisions. After all, she’s confident that her children would always need her. The matriarch also knows that no other manager will ever be as invested in her children’s lives as she is. So, she’s obviously not going anywhere.</p><p>But if Kim and Kourtney really did fire their mom, this would’ve gravely affected Jenner’s net worth. After all, Jenner charges each of her children a 10% management fee. This means that for every deal that her kids would make, Jenner receives a 10% income. And closing deals aren’t hard for Jenner, who has been in the industry for decades.</p><p>Four years ago, <a href=#>TMZ </a>reported that Jenner secured a $150 million contract for new seasons of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. From this deal alone, Jenner earned $15 million. Between 2016 and 2017, Kim made $45 million from her business ventures. Throughout this year, <a href=#>Jenner earned $4.5 million from her second child alone</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than Kourtney and Kim, Jenner also receives a hefty sum from her youngest child, Kylie Jenner. According to <a href=#>Business Insider</a>, Kylie paid her mom $17 million in 2018 after she hired her to be her manager.</p><p><a href=#>Jenner’s net worth of $190 million</a> is also expected to increase in the coming months or years. During her recent interview, she told O’Neill that she spoke to Kylie recently and they came up with three business ideas.</p><p>If Kylie’s businesses push through, Jenner will receive 10 percent from each one of them.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>15 Times Kris Jenner Worked Her Magic (And Made Millions Using Her Daughters)</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Insider</a>, <a href=#>Business Insider</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4s7XSZqGepp6av263yJ2qZqyirnqntdGeZKGdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
