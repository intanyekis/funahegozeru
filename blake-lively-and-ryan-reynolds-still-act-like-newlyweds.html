They’ve got four beautiful kids and have built an amazing life together,” a source exclusively shares in the latest issue of Us Weekly, revealing that Lively, 36, and Reynolds, 46, celebrated their recent anniversary with a nice dinner and a quiet evening at home.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>“They’re very romantic together,” the insider adds. “They’re always holding hands — you’d think they were newlyweds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>The couple — who tied the knot in September 2012 — are the proud parents of daughters James, 8, Inez, 6, Betty, 3, and a fourth child they secretly welcomed earlier this year. While the pair may be busy — <a href=#>and occasionally tired</a> — with a full house, their growing brood has only brought them closer.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>“Blake and Ryan have this unbreakable bond as a couple,” an insider exclusively told Us in June 2022, adding that the twosome are still very “much in love” and “secure” after more than a decade of marriage. “They are still head over heels for each other.”&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blake-Lively-and-Ryan-Reynolds-Still-Act-Like-Newlyweds-After-11-Years-of-Marriage-344.jpg></p><p dir=ltr>Reynolds and Lively have found a rhythm with parenting and marriage that works for them — <a href=#>which includes low-key date nights</a> — and they remain “committed to each other for life,” the source told Us at the time. The couple enjoyed a night on the town in London in July, attending a performance of Matilda: The Musical. Earlier this month,<a href=#> they were spotted holding hands</a> while taking a quiet stroll in New York City.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>When date nights don’t fit into the schedule — Lively recently rolled out her Betty Buzz company and Reynolds is the co-owner of Wrexham AFC and Aviation Gin — the lovebirds <a href=#>turn to social media to keep the romance alive</a>.

While they were both seeing other people at the time, they remained close friends until a double date — with other partners — led to a spark between them. It’s that foundation of friendship that has allowed their bond to blossom.&nbsp;<b></b></p><p dir=ltr>“We were friends and buddies, and about a year and a half later, we actually went out on a double date. But we were dating separate people,” Reynolds shared during an appearance on the “<a href=# rel=noopener>SmartLess</a>” podcast in July 2021. “We hung out and we always kind of kept in touch sort of casually and, next thing you know, she was going to Boston. I was going to Boston and I said, ‘I’ll ride with you.’ … <a href=#>I was just begging her to sleep with me</a>.”</p><p dir=ltr>For more on Lively and Reynolds’ love story, pick up an issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabpJGgsm64yK%2BcpbFdlruledGymKdloprGr7vLnapmq6Seua15wJyrZqSZoLJuusSwo7KvlZnAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
