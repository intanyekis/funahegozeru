Not only he emerged as the best assist maker in the French league, he recorded numbers that were only rivaled by great Lionel Messi. His performances in the physically demanding and fast-paced Premier League with West Ham proved that he was a truly exceptional player. However, his bitter departure from West Ham ruined his legacy with the club’s devoted fans. They even removed his mural from outside the ground. But he did earn fans with Marseille with his silky and elegant playing style.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Dimitri Payet</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Dimitri</p><figure id=attachment_112658 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-112658 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dimitri Payet during the match between France and Armenia in 2014 (Xavier NALTCHAYAN / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Flickr</a> / CC BY-SA 2.0)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Aries</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Saint-Pierre,&nbsp;Réunion, France</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3></h3><h3>Education</h3><p>Dimitri Payet polished his soccer skills in the youth academy of <strong>Le Havre</strong>.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Soccer Player</p><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father –&nbsp;</strong>Alain Payet</li><li><strong>Mother –&nbsp;</strong>Michelle Payet</li></ul><h3>Position</h3><p>Attacking Midfielder, Winger</p><h3>Shirt Number</h3><p>31, 33 –&nbsp;FC Nantes</p><p>7 –&nbsp;AS Saint-Étienne,&nbsp;LOSC Lille</p><p>12 –&nbsp;AS Saint-Étienne, France National Team</p><p>17 –&nbsp;Olympique Marseille, France National Team</p><p>27 – West Ham United</p><p>10, 11 –&nbsp;Olympique Marseille</p><p>8, 10, 24 – France National Team</p><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>5 ft 9 in or 175 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>76 kg or 167.5 lbs</p><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Dimitri Payet has dated –</p><li><strong>Ludivine Lacrone</strong> (2007-Present) – Dimitri Payet started going out with&nbsp;Ludivine Lacrone in 2007.

He had been sent as a substitute and scored within 2 minutes of having come in the match.</li><li>In the 2006 summer, he signed his first professional contract as he inked a three year deal with Nantes. Ahead of the 2006-2007 season, he was officially integrated into the senior squad and handed 31 squad number.</li><li>In his first full season with Nantes, he scored 4 goals in 30 league appearances. However, he was unable to help his side avoid relegation.</li><li>As he wanted to remain in the French top flight, he decided to hand in transfer request. He eventually decided to join&nbsp;Saint-Étienne and Nantes received&nbsp;€4&nbsp;million transfer fee for the player.</li><li>In his debut season with&nbsp;Saint-Étienne, he struggled to perform for the club and couldn’t score any goal or provide assists in his 31 appearances. His best performances came in his final and 4th season with the French club as he scored 13 goals in 33 matches.</li><li>In recognition of his great performances for Lille in the 2012-13 season, he was included in the&nbsp;UNFP’s Ligue 1 team of the season. He had recorded 12 assists, which made him&nbsp;league’s joint-top assistmaker, alongside&nbsp;Mathieu Valbuena, and had scored 12 goals as well.</li><li>In June 2013, he was bought by Olympique de Marseille for the transfer fee of&nbsp;€11 million.</li><li>In 2014 summer, Marseille made Marcelo Bielsa the new head coach. And, Bielsa completely transformed Payet’s game as he moved him from wings and made him the playmaker of the team. He ended the season with 17 assists and had completed second&nbsp;successful through-balls after <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lionel Messi</a>.</li><li>In June 2015, he was sold by Marseille to West Ham United against his wishes. The club was struggling for financial stability and the transfer fee of&nbsp;£10.7 million did resolve their financial problems. But it eventually led to Bielsa resigning as a coach in August.</li><li>In August 2016, he scored his first goal for West Ham United as he netted one in his side’s 1-2 defeat against Leicester City. Next, he scored a brace in 2-0 win over Newcastle in September.</li><li>In recognition of his great performances, West Ham offered him a new 5 and a half years contract in February 2016. The new contract extended his stay with the club until 2021 and increased his salary to&nbsp;£125,000 a week.</li><li>In February 2016, he was declared&nbsp;as the Premier League Player of the Year at the London Football Awards. He was also recognized as&nbsp;the&nbsp;West Ham United Player of the Year in May at the annual club awards event.</li><li>In January 2017, he sealed a return to Marseille as they paid&nbsp;£25 million to the English Club. West Ham had previously rejected two bids from the French side but Payet went on a strike to force transfer.</li><li>In the 2016 UEFA Euro final, he executed a poor tackle on <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, which led to an injury and subsequent withdrawal of Portuguese star after 25 minutes in the match. Payet was widely condemned on the social media for his poor play.</li><li>While playing in UEFA Europa League final in May 2018 against&nbsp;Atlético Madrid, he suffered an injury and was substituted in the 31st minute. In his absence, Marseille lost by 3-0 with some fans pointing out that it was heavenly retribution for his tackle on Ronaldo in the 2016 Euro.</li><li>Follow him on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Xavier NALTCHAYAN / <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Flickr</a> / CC BY-SA 2.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp2gpqGkp7ZuvMCynK1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
