Nearly 10 years later in 2006, they shared their journey in the documentary <i>Joined for Life </i>and later chronicled their 16th birthday milestone in 2008. TLC also greenlit an <i>Abby & Brittany </i>docuseries in 2012.</p><p class=p1>The sisters are dicephalous conjoined twins, which is a rare form of partial twinning with two heads connected to one torso.
