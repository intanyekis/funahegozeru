Their private function was held in Los Angeles on Saturday at St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/14/Dr-Paul-Nassif-Is-Married-to-Brittany-Pattakos-landing-1571058199968.jpg><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Their big celebration, however, was held on the Greek island of Santorini </a>on October 6, among 65 guests surrounded the newly married couple at the romantic reception. Moreover, Brittany said in the events.</p><p>“Paul and I are incredibly grateful to have family and friends from around the world join us in the blessing of our marriage here in Santorini, Greece. We are equally as thankful for the family we had at our official wedding ceremony in Los Angeles on September 28th, 2019.”</p><p>On the big day, the bride wore a backless white lace gown and sparkling headpiece, while the groom stunned sleek in a light grey suit with a pink tie in the reception.&nbsp;</p><h2>When Brittany and Nassif started to date?</h2><p>The couple was first spotted together in July 2017. They also have a considerable age gap where M.D. Paul is 29 years older than Pattakos. More to that, the love birds prove, age is just a number, and you didn't require a perfect age to match your partner.</p><p>In fact, on June 1, when Botched's Dr. proposed to Pattakos a few days before his birthday, the pair shared a declaration of engagement. On Instagram, Paul shared an engagement video stating the caption. "This weekend, I found out that with my soulmate, I can spend the rest of my life. # SheSaidYes,"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/14/custom_1571058678538-1571058730447.jpg><p>In the post, the duo capturing on a boat ride where Nassif falls to a knee approaching Brittany, "will you marry me?". Then a CoolSculpting specialist Pattakos accepts the proposal.</p><p>Similarly, Pattakos also raved about the engagement on Instagram and said," Best day of my life! I get to marry my best friend!".</p><h2>Dr. Paul Nassif's First Marriage</h2><p>Lebanese-American plastic surgeon was previously wedded to his former wife,&nbsp;<strong>Adrienne Maloof</strong>.

Moreover, the couple tied the knot in 2002, but they divorced in 2012 after 10 years of marital life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/14/brittany-pattakos-is-paul-nassifs-second-wife-1570549990-1571053717442.jpg><p>The separation of Dr. and Maloof was quite unpleasant and involved a bitter battle of custody. They have a much more friendly relationship since then. In 2015 with Radar Online, Nassif stated:&nbsp;</p><p>"One thing that Adrienne and I have done, since time does really take care of things, our relationship now, especially because we have three beautiful boys, is actually quite good."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The former lovebirds are still on good terms even after the split. Not only this, but his current wife also shares friendly terms with Adrienne as they had the first meeting on the second date of Pattakos and Nassif.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/14/brittany-pattakos-and-adrienne-maloof-are-on-good-terms-too-1570549990-1571053680644.jpg><p>Brittany also shares a healthy equation with Nassif kids.
