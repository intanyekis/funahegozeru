The first verse of the song describes the cold weather, but the singer doesn't seem to mind because he has a heater in his truck and is headed to the rodeo. The chorus repeats the phrase "alla man left and alla man right," which refers to a specific type of rodeo event where cowboys ride horses and attempt to lasso steers.</p><br><p>The second verse introduces a character named Johnny who is described as having only one testicle. The chorus repeats again with the addition of the phrase "come on you fuckin' dummy, get your right step right," which serves as a humorous commentary on the perceived lack of intelligence of the rodeo performers. The song concludes with a final chorus and the repeated phrase "you piss me off, you fuckin' jerk, you get on my nerves."</p><br><p>Overall, the song is a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the rodeo world and the colorful characters who inhabit it. The use of profanity and crude humor adds to the comedic effect of the song.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Well it's 40 below and I don't give a fuck,</u><br>I don't care that it's -40 degrees outside</p><br><p><u>Got a heater in my truck and I'm off to the rodeo</u><br>I have a heater in my truck and I'm going to the rodeo</p><br><p><u>It's an alla man left and alla man right</u><br>The dance steps for this song are all left and all right</p><br><p><u>Come on you fuckin' dummy get your right step right</u><br>Come on, stop messing up the dance steps</p><br><p><u>Get off stage you god damn goof you know</u><br>You're embarrassing yourself, get off the stage</p><br><p><u>You piss me off, you fuckin' jerk</u><br>You're making me angry with your incompetence</p><br><p><u>You get on my nerves</u><br>Your behavior is irritating me</p><br><p><u>Here comes Johnny with his pecker in his hand,</u><br>Johnny is coming over here with his penis exposed</p><br><p><u>He's a one ball man and he's off to the rodeo</u><br>Johnny only has one testicle and he's also going to the rodeo</p><br><p><u>Well it's 40 below and I ain't got a truck</u><br>I don't have a truck and it's still -40 outside</p><br><p><u>and I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm off to the rodeo</u><br>But I don't care because I'm still going to the rodeo</p><br><p><u>You piss me off, you fuckin' jerk</u><br>You're still making me angry</p><br><p><u>You get on my nerves</u><br>You're still being irritating</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Christian C.
