After witnessing a driver swerve off the road and his car do a full turn, the rapper intervened, and discovered that the man was in diabetic shock. Layzie then along with others, helped stabilize him by giving him fruit and chocolate. In an interview with local news station KTWO, the Bone Thug shrugged off the “hero” title.</p><p>“I’m not doing this interview to be no type of ‘hero,’ like they put it. I’m not that person; I genuinely care about people,” he said.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>Interview: Krayzie Bone Proposes Bone Thugs/Wu-Tang LP, Talks Challenging Eminem And $1 Million ‘Legends’ Album</a></strong></p><p>Layzie Bone also <a href=# rel=nofollow>took to Instagram</a>&nbsp;following the dangerous incident to share what took place. He went on with his scheduled performance later that night as well:</p><p>Dear Lord, thank you for your mercy, grace and forgiveness for 2nd chances. We just witnessed a man 24 years old driving super erratically from Casper Wyoming to Riverton Wyoming. We thought he was a drunk doing 60mph when he spun out of control and did a complete 180• degrees, Thank God he didn’t flip he was 30 ft in front of us. Turns out after we stopped to check on him he was having a diabetic shock. Thanks to the EMS on the scene that happens to be driving right behind us from Indiana and the cute old couple in the RV for the apples and oranges we gave him. My heart is still racing. Again, thank you Jahovah for protecting this young man and thanks that we didn’t have to witness the worse.@TONYBFBG WHEW now let’s do this show. Be safe people Layzie loves ya.</p><p>Peep Layzie Bone’s post below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GuusbInmSbp56aerSt1Z6qZqSZm7Juw9iopKKml2KAdYSTb21o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
