Even stars that have chemistry on-set, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">don't always feel that way behind the scenes.</a> In truth, the land of the rich and famous is an odd place, filled with judgment. It takes a thick skin to survive.</p><p>Now, a friendship coming to an end can't harm a career, though it isn't the best look, especially when details start to emerge. Oh how many examples we've seen in the past, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry and Rihanna</a>, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag, along with countless others are obvious examples of names that were close, only to see the friendship shattered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Moment Kim Kardashian Surpassed Paris Hilton In Popularity And Wealth</a></span></p><p>Reasonings tend to differ, though when it comes to these two A-listers, it is a little ridiculous in truth. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a></strong> and Gwyneth Paltrow were very close, and they developed a great friendship.</p><p>Though it all came crashing down because of a certain dispute, one that involved a trainer, Tracy Anderson.</p><p>Let's find out the details, along with their rocky history alongside other celebs.</p><h2 id=paltrow-amp-madonna-have-received-shade-from-others>Paltrow & Madonna Have Received Shade From Others</h2><p>Let's start with Gwyneth, who looks like a pure sweetheart. Don't tell that to Winona Ryder, as the two were once very close, that is until Ryder made the claim that Paltrow stole a script from her. Not any script, an award-winning role for 'Shakespeare in Love.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Winona Ryder And Gwyneth Paltrow Friends Or Enemies?</a></span></p><p>Paltrow denied the allegations while Ryder never went public. Ultimately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow finally discussed things</a>, stating that Ryder got some karma handed to her, though she didn't specifically state that Ryder was the one she was referring to.</p><p>“This person really did what they could to hurt me,” Paltrow wrote. “I was deeply upset, I was angry, I was all of those things you feel when you find out that someone you thought you liked was venomous and dangerous.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One day I heard that something unfortunate and humiliating had happened to this person. My reaction was deep relief and…happiness. There went the high road. So, why does it feel so good to hear something bad about someone you don’t like?”</p><p>Madonna hasn't had the easiest time either - it is believed that she tends to stick to a certain entourage at all times. J-Lo would also completely rip into the star years ago, though Madonna would never react to the harsh words.</p><p>This leads us to our next dispute, one few fans saw coming, except for their trainer, Tracy Anderson.</p><h2 id=personal-trainer-problems>Personal Trainer Problems</h2><p>The schedule of a celebrity isn't easy to follow. Tracy Anderson, Madonna's former trainer learned about that very early on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two were introduced through Gwyneth Paltrow. Anderson would admit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was hard to keep up with Madonna's demands.</a></p><p>"Madonna can demand whatever she wants to demand, she's Madonna, that's just what it is. It wasn't working for me because my demands are, like, I have a kid."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salma Hayek Almost Lost This Movie Role To Madonna</a></span></p><p>"When I missed my son's saxophone concert because of a training session with her, I was like "I can't do this anymore. That was it for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna ended up dropping her trainer, and this is what caused the dispute between Paltrow and Madonna. Soon enough, Madonna was basically ousted from the entourage.</p><p>It was especially surprising, given all the love Madonna had demonstrated for her trainer, who played a huge role in getting her back on track.</p><p>"Tracy Anderson is my savior. After two Caesareans, three hernia operations and one riding accident that left me with 10 broken bones, she was the only one who could pull my body back together into one piece.'"</p><p>Despite the fallout, Anderson was just fine.</p><h2 id=the-trainer-amp-paltrow-kept-close-but-not-with-madonna>The Trainer & Paltrow Kept Close... But Not With Madonna</h2><p>Ultimately, Madonna went her own way, while Gwyneth kept close to her trainer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow shows a lot of love to Tracy</a> and all their work together over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Anderson, she's used to all the attention, given she works alongside some major names in the entertainment world.</p><p>"Gwyneth directed my first two DVDs and talked about me to Oprah [Winfrey]."</p><p>"It's a genuine relationship, but we're very different. She's five-foot-10 with a metabolism that doesn't quit and I'm barely five feet tall and I will gain a pound a day if I don't exercise. I would never win if I measured my progress or goals against hers; we come to fitness from two different places."</p><p>At least they remained pals...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Iconic Movie That Gwyneth Paltrow Called A “Disaster”</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiesLGemsGpec%2Bao62qn6x6prrDnptmoJWneqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr1uw8itn2alkZm8r7rAZp2oql2ptaq%2FjKucmqufo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
