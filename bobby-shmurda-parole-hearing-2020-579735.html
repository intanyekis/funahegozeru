While his full term will not conclude until 2022, new reports suggest the rapper could be getting out on parole as early as 2020.</p><p>The “Hot N***a” artist will reportedly have a parole hearing in Aug. 2020. If all things go according to plan, he could be eligible for&nbsp;an early release&nbsp;by Dec. 2020, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a>.</p><p>The early parole is based on the prison system’s “time served” rule, according to sources. The 23-year-old reportedly sat in jail awaiting trial from Dec. 2014 until his sentencing in 2016. That being the case, he reportedly racked up a total of 685 days in prison. That tally is equivalent to nearly two years time served, which is why his sentence lessens to 2020 instead of 2022.</p><p>Shmurda is reportedly doing time for conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession and reckless endangerment. While behind bars, the rapper has received a total of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">11 violations</a> for drug possession, fighting, and carrying a shank. So he’ll have to clean up his act if he would like to stay on track for an early parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Shmurda is currently serving time in Upstate New York’s Clinton Correctional Facility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8o67YZqqhpaWnsaJ5z5qpqKSVYrWmrdGipaBlYmV%2FcXmUcHBwa2Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
