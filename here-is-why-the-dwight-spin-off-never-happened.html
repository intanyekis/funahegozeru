The beloved, hard-working salesman almost hit the jackpot with his own show titled </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Farm</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Farm </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>centers around Dwight and accountant Oscar. They go to Schrute Farms to attend the funeral of Dwight's Aunt Shirley. While in attendance, Dwight learns that he inherited Schrute Farms. The episode proceeds to give watchers a peek into his personal life. The show would have included Dwight's sister Fannie Schrute, her son Cameron Whitman, his brother Jeb Schrute, and their great uncle Heinrich Manheim.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office: When Did Dwight And Angela Start Dating?</a></span></p><p>The seventeenth episode of the ninth season was intended to introduce the characters that would be in the spin-off while keeping the documentary filming style.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to an article published by </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Looper</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, the actor who played Dwight (Rainn Wilson) had previously teased that The Farm would be "even more far out and weirder than The Office."

Wilson confirmed on Twitter that NBC had rejected the spin-off series. This news was announced months before the episode aired.</p><p>"Farm Update: NBC has passed on moving forward with The Farm TV show," he posted.

According to an article published by </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Screen Rant</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><span style=font-weight:400>many fans felt that it lacked elements that made </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Office</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> special.&nbsp;Also, viewers thought it was too late for a spin-off. <i>The Office</i> was ending and fans thought an immediate spin-off wouldn’t have been the right move. Fans wanted to remember Dwight as he was on the show. His chapter, along with the rest of the characters, deserved to end along with the show.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>In a review written by Alan Sepinwall for </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Uproxx</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, he said, "As a surreal, occasional accent on the mundane world of The Office, Dwight's beet farm and the weird Schrute family traditions can be incredibly funny. As the center of a show, though, I reacted to it in much the way Oscar did when Dwight started pumping shotgun rounds into the coffin. Even the scene where Dwight teaches his nephew how to milk an animal; while humanizing, wasn't enough to compensate for the cartoonishness elsewhere."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dwight-the-farm-spin-off.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>If the pilot episode performed successfully, Dwight’s fate on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Office</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> would have changed everything. The plan was for Wilson to be in 13 episodes of the final season and then leave to tap </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Farm</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. If he made an exit before the show’s finale, would he have proposed to Angela? The wedding was the event where everyone, including Michael Scott, reunited. After the wedding, everyone went back to the office to spend one final moment together before they went their separate ways.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Would 'The Office' Cast Be Paid For A Reunion Special?</a></span></p><p>Furthermore, he&nbsp;was given&nbsp;the Regional Manager position, which is something he strived for since the start of the show.
