Caroline was in attendance alongside husband <strong>Albert Manzo</strong> and <a href=#>children</a> <a href=#><strong>Lauren</strong></a> and <strong>Chris Manzo</strong>. Days before Albie’s wedding, news broke that Lauren’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Vito Scalia</strong></a>, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> after eight years of marriage, though she revealed via Instagram their divorce had been “<a href=#>for a very long time</a>.”</p><p>“Happy wedding day @albiemanzo @chelseademonaco!” the <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> star, 62, wrote via her Instagram Story alongside a photo of her view of the venue. “We love you! ❤️❤️.”</p><p>Ahead of their nuptials, DeMonaco, 29, shared a picture of the Italian countryside as they prepared for their big day. “Home for the next week 🤍👰🏽‍♀️🤵🏽‍♂️🇮🇹,” she penned on Sunday, October 22.</p><p>Albie and DeMonaco began dating in 2019 and made their relationship official during the holiday season. After four years of dating, Albie <a href=#>got down on one knee</a> in April.</p><p>“To an unforgettable night surrounded by all our loved ones ✨💍 Also big shout out to Big Al for taking the hit on what was supposed to be his birthday dinner celebration,” DeMonaco gushed at the time. “Promise we will gift you with some gran babies eventually.”</p><p>Caroline, for her part, couldn’t help but celebrate and share the exciting news for herself.</p><p>“She said YES!!!! Congratulations to @albiemanzo and @chelseademonaco on their engagement!” Caroline wrote via Instagram alongside a photo of the happy couple. “We love you both to bits and are excited for this new chapter in all of our lives. Wedding bells will be ringing!!!! 💍❤️❤️.”</p><p>Two months after the proposal, Caroline joined DeMonaco as she was on the hunt for her wedding dress as the pair planned on exchanging vows <a href=#>before the year ended</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When you have a wedding in less than six months and you are met with the most professional staff that bend over backwards to accommodate,” the reality star shared in June. “Not only did @chelseademonaco say “yes to the dress” it is the most magical, perfect, dress that is truly meant for her. Thank you @antonella_tlc @angelriveraatelier for making our girl feel so special.”</p><p>The Manzo family made their RHONJ debut for season 1 in 2009. Caroline departed the series after season 5. However, she and her family continued on Bravo in a spinoff series titled Manzo’d with Children which aired for three seasons from 2014 to 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2Bjt26ty66kZpmcl7amecyapbOnXZa7pXnCoZylq5WWeqWxzKilmpufYsSmsIyipWahpJa5uns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
