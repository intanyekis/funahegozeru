"Love Incredible" starts mellow, but picks up with a thumping drumbeat once the chorus hits.</p><p>"This love's incredible, credible / Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me," Cabello, 19, sings. "Wanting more, wanting more of your love."</p><p>It is unclear if "Love Incredible" is a track from the Cuban American songstress' first solo album or Cashmere Cat's forthcoming record, <i>Wild Love</i>. Either way, it marks Cabello's first official song as a solo artist, though she had recorded features for other artists while still a member of Fifth Harmony. Last year, Cabello collaborated with <b>Machine Gun Kelly</b> on his ballad "Bad Things."</p><span class=caption></span><p>Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, <a href=#>performed for the first time as a quartet</a> earlier this month at the 2017 People's Choice Awards. Remaining members <b>Lauren Jauregui</b>, <b>Normani Kordei</b>, <b>Dinah Jane Hansen</b> and <b>Ally Brooke Hernandez</b>, who have already begun recording new music without Cabello, wowed the audience with a dance-heavy performance of their 2016 hit "Work From Home." They were scheduled to sing the national anthem at the NHL All-Star Game on Sunday, January 29, but were forced to cancel at the last minute after Hansen, 19, "became sick and had to be treated by paramedics," <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported.</p><p>The girl group, which was formed on season 2 of <i>The X Factor</i> in 2012, announced on social media on December 18, 2016, that <a href=#>Cabello had left the group</a>. In an icy statement, the girls claimed they had been informed of the budding solo artist's departure "via her representatives," but Cabello later <a href=#>denied the allegation in a message of her own</a>. "I did not intend to end things with Fifth Harmony this way," she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Listen to "Love Incredible" below!</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7PDE8xXK55g</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ2euaJ5wpqZnqScpMBussirqq1lo6S5sHnSoqWgpJViuaatyqxkmp6kmr9ussifq6FlmJa%2FrrvNsmSesJmperiAlWxuaW1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
