She is credited with popularizing French cuisine in America through her debut cookbook, “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” and went on to publish 16 more cookbooks and a memoir.

Meryl Streep portrayed her in the 2009 film “Julie & Julia.”</p><h2><span id=Julia_Childs_Early_Life>Julia Child’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Julia Child was born in Pasadena, California, in 1912 to Julia Weston and John McWilliams, Jr. She had two younger siblings and attended Polytechnic School and Katherine Branson School. After graduating from high school, she earned a degree in history from Smith College in Massachusetts in 1934. Despite not learning to cook until her thirties, she later became a renowned chef.</p><h2><span id=Julia_Childs_Career_Highlights>Julia Child’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>After college, Julia moved to New York City and took a job as a copywriter in W. & J. Sloane’s advertising department. In 1942, she joined the Office of Strategic Services as a typist. Child was later promoted to a top-secret researcher under General William J. Donovan. Julia received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service while serving as the head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat. When too many underwater OSS explosives were being set off by sharks, Child solved the problem by experimenting with various concoctions that were sprinkled near the explosives.</p><p>After attending the Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, Julia studied with master chefs such as Max Bugnard, and she joined Le Cercle des Gourmettes, a women’s cooking club. The trio began teaching cooking classes for American women in 1951, and a decade later, they published “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” followed by “Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two” in 1970.</p><p>After the success of “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” Julia began writing magazine articles as well as a column for “The Boston Globe.” She published numerous cookbooks and appeared on several TV shows, including “The French Chef,” “Julia Child & Company,” and “Julia & Jacques Cooking at Home.” In 1981, Child co-founded the American Institute of Wine & Food to “advance the understanding, appreciation and quality of wine and food.” Three of Child’s shows were filmed in her kitchen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in 2001, she agreed to donate the kitchen to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.</p><h2><span id=Julia_Childs_Life_and_Legacy>Julia Child’s Life and Legacy</span></h2><p>Julia Child married Paul Cushing Child in 1946 after meeting him while he was stationed in Ceylon with the Office of Strategic Services. They moved to Paris, where Julia took cooking classes at Le Cordon Bleu, and later settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After Paul’s death in 1994, Julia founded The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and Culinary Arts to continue her impact as a teacher and mentor. The Foundation now gives out the Julia Child Award and grants to nonprofit organizations.</p><h2><span id=Julia_Childs_Passing_and_Legacy>Julia Child’s Passing and Legacy</span></h2><p>Julia Child passed away on August 13, 2004, at 92 years old due to kidney failure.
