The rapper dropped his only full solo album alive, Ready to Die, in September 1994 and, per RIAA, it had already gone Gold by November 1994.</p><p>The iconic rapper is back in the spotlight thanks to the powerful documentary Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell, which is available on Netflix. The rapper’s first child is T’yanna Wallace.</p><p>She was born on August 8, 1993, to Biggie’s ex-girlfriend Jan Jackson. T’yanna’s budding star father married R&B singer Faith Evans.</p><p>Two years later on October 26, 1996, Evans gave birth to Biggie’s second and final child, C. J. Wallace. Just a few months later, on March 9, 1997, The Notorious Big was shot and killed while leaving a Soul Train Music Awards after-party.</p><p>T’yanna was 3-and-a-half years old, while C. J. was less than five months. Neither has any memory of their father&nbsp;but his friends and family have reminisced about him to his offspring extensively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqZnLSqsYyspJqknKh6rLXDrGSwoJ9irrOxjKemraeinry2v4ybZKJll6h6pLTIpZurnZ5isG62jLCYpaSRmLJurc2dZK2xkaO7onnWmqOlmZOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
