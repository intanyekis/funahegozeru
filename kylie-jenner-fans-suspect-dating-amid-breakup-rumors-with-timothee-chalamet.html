The outlet notes that Wojcik had previously made a post on social media about "them Kylie Jenner lips." When the reporter asked the shooting guard to comment on these "rumors," he replied by saying, "I can't speak on that either." <strong>It does appear that he was joking. Still, that has not stopped people from taking to social media to question what is going on</strong>.</p><p>He has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">modeled for Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims</a>. It was always incredibly unlikely that Wojcik and Jenner were a couple, but even his manager, TJ Beisner, commented on the situation in an interview with TMZ. He said Wojcik and Jenner had not spoken, and "he didn't mean any harm ... and he now realizes he was inappropriate with his joking." <strong>He has reportedly since relayed a message of regret to Jenner's team</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner just can't catch a break, and she is currently dealing with <a href=#>breakup rumors about her relationship with Timothée Chalamet</a>.

Their coupling received a lot of attention, and when fans saw <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos of them kissing on a yacht</a>, everyone had an opinion. Chalamet addressed this in an interview with GQ in 2020.</p><p>"I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life," he said. "I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved, and closing my eyes, I was like, indisputably, 'That was great.'
