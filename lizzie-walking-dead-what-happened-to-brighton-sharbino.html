I am so grateful for my time on the show because I have had a lot more opportunities over the past few years,” the actress said. “I have been working on some really cool projects and I’m excited!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-went-on-to-play-jennifer-garner-s-daughter>She Went On To Play Jennifer Garner’s Daughter</h2><p>Miracles from Heaven was one of the first projects that Sharbino worked on after exiting The Walking Dead.

I've never read a script that quick!” the actress told Girl’s Life. “It was really entertaining for me, so that was one thing I thought was very special. And then, when we get into the logistics of it, even the way it was shot was really special because we shot it all vertically for Snapchat!”</p><p>Around the time that Sharbino was starring in the series, the actress also found time to work on the action film Beckman.
