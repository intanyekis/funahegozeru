People love drama, and apparently there’s a lot of it in international relationships between visa applications and plane tickets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the amount of financial hardships played out on the show, it’s no surprise that many of the couples fail to make it, including Andrew Keaton and Amira Lollysa.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian & Scott Disick Sued For $40 Million Over Instagram Scam</a></span></p><p>The couple appeared on season eight of 90 Day Fiancé when Amira was trying to come to the U.S. from France at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. She ended up calling things off, claiming Andrew was controlling.</p><p>Andrew received a lot of backlash for his portrayal on the show after it aired, causing the daycare worker to lay low from the public eye.</p><p>However, Andrew recently opened up about how he’s moving on from his failed engagement – he just sold Amira’s ring. But Andrew said he was disappointed with how much he got for it.</p><p>Speaking directly to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Andrew explained that he listed the diamond on eBay. It was up for grabs for 10 days before a buyer was secured. The ring sold for $2,250.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Andrew says the ring was worth triple the price. He apparently bought it from Neil Lane for $7,300 in 2019. It’s a “princess-cut emerald, sitting atop a crown of diamonds and set in 14k white gold.” Though he had 24 interested buys, it’s unclear why it went for undervalue.</p><p>Nevertheless, Andrew says he’s happy the ring is finally gone from his possession and he’s looking forward to fully moving on.</p><p>Though it’s been two years since their break-up, Andrew reportedly had a difficult time getting the engagement ring back from Amira. According to reports, she was holding the ring hostage unless her ex sent her makeup products.</p><p>“ <a href=#>She wanted Kim Kardashian West makeup</a> , and so I put it all in a big package and sent it to her and she sent me the ring," Andrew said during an appearance on The Domenick Nati Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said that he sent her around $200-300 worth of makeup, and Amira held up her end of the deal by sending him the ring in return.</p><p>Andrew also claimed that Amira demanded a lot of money throughout their relationship. He estimates to have spent “probably $30k - $40k” on his ex-fiancé.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye Is Launching A New Brand, Also Expanding Donda Sports</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>ScreenRant</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5hpZJ2ZqWLAta3RZpinnKKaxG63xJqrqKZdqLKtuNJmnLGrXae2r7OMn6arZWNiwaq5xKxkpZ2jqHq1tMCnZKKso2LDorjUnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
