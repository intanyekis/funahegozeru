Now that he might be dating <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, his profile has risen even more. Even people who don't follow sports are aware of who he is, and that means learning about his former relationships as well.</p><p>Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole is an influencer, reporter, and model who has an amazing follower count on Instagram. It seems likely that she is used to having people talk about her. But when she was dating Kelce, she definitely had to deal with his celebrity status, and that might have been tough. Even though she and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end are broken up now, he has still affected her life in certain ways. For instance, <a href=#>Nicole's friendship with Brittany Mahomes seems to be over</a>. Here's the truth about how Kayla Nicole feels about Travis Kelce's star power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-travis-kelce-39-s-ex-girlfriend-kayla-nicole-say-about-his-fame>What Did Travis Kelce's Ex-Girlfriend Kayla Nicole Say About His Fame?</h2><p>Although it can be tough and tricky to date a well-known football player, Kayla Nicole doesn't seem to have commented on her ex-boyfriend Travis Kelce's fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-taylor-swift-destroy-brittany-mahomes-close-friendship-with-travis-kelce-s-ex-girlfriend-kayla-nicole_.jpg><p><a href=#>Kelce's ex Maya Benberry called him a "narcissist,"</a> but Kayla Nicole hasn't talked very much about her relationship or her breakup. Of course, that doesn't mean that she always loved the experience of being in a relationship with him, or that she liked how much people talked about her as a result. But unless she wants to share with her fanbase what it was really like to date Travis Kelce, people will be left in the dark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Sportskeeda, Nicole might have spoken about Kelce on her Instagram account at least once. She posted a photo of herself and wrote in the caption, "Talking bout 'I want to see other people.' Yea ok boy, pick your fighter." It's possible that this is what Kelce said to her when they broke up, but since she didn't explain more, people can only speculate.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/aaron-rodgers-travis-kelce.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Aaron Rodgers And Travis Kelce's Relationship Before Their Debate Drama</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Do star athletes Aaron Rodgers and Travis Kelce actually get along or is there trouble behind the scenes?</span><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayla Nicole shared a video on Instagram</a> and talked about going through hard times, she might have been thinking about her breakup. However, she didn't mention Travis Kelce specifically.</p><p>According to The Daily Mail, she said, "Kayla here, It's always been really important to me to use my platform not to create division but to elevate and unite women - black women specifically. So I prepared a letter and would like to share it with you today."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/th-image-template-25.jpg><p>Nicole continued, "I'm reminded that this isn't just about me. This isn't just my story. A singular experience. My truth, trauma and vulnerability is a relatable part of the human experience. I know I'm not alone. And I want to make sure you know you're not either.

Although it's hard to find any interviews with her online since she mostly posts on her social media accounts, she does speak up when she has something important to say. She often shares these thoughts on her Twitter account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kayla-nicole-5.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, The Sun reported in January 2023 that people said that Kelce was "cheap." He explained when he was interviewed on The Pivot Podcast, "I would never say that I was supporting her. She had a very financially stable life and what she was doing in her career." Nicole then tweeted, "Not sure where y’all got this nonsense from, but it’s absurd and very false."</p><p>In 2022, quarterback Cam Newton said that it's a problem when women "can't cook." According to Fansided.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole tweeted a response to Newton's comments</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/how-did-travis-kelce-s-ex-girlfriend-kayla-nicole-really-feel-about-the-football-player-s-fame_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She didn't like that he said that and tweeted that women should never be obligated to make a meal for someone who they are dating. She then tweeted, "I don’t have 'beef' with anyone. I have beef with the ideation that reduces a woman’s worth to what’s being put on a dinner plate. This narrative was publicly shared on a podcast, it’s important for it 2 be publicly denounced.
