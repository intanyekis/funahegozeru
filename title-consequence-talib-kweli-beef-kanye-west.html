Accountability Is Everything In Life. This Shirt Was/Is A Bad Idea. Wisdom Is Learning From Your Mistakes And Then Moving On. Queens Get The Money.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The Band Camp Records head then tweeted out an old photo of him and a young Ye being interviewed while lounging on some beach chairs.</p><p>“I’ve stood with YE for 20 years and have always had his back,” Consequence continued. “He trust me more than ANYBODY Part of that is seeing things for what they are Whether G.O.O.D. or Bad Then from there making sure WE are moving in the right direction.

The article involved Yassin Bey donning Ye’s inflammatory White Lives Matter shirt, except that he had altered it to read White Lies Matter.</p><p>“Yea you tried it. But you failed tho,” Kweli added.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“This clown ass n-gga Talib Kweli writing Encyclopedias in my comment section on IG,” Con wrote on Twitter, where Talib Kweli has been <a class=underline-link href=#>permanently banned</a>. “Talib Kweli F R I E D N-gga mad about YE interview on @drink champs.”</p><p>He continued: “Was at Chris Rock + Dave Chappelle telling me he don’t want No Smoke with YE but then wanna be an Internet Thug in the comments.

Let’s not play no stupid games. One minute You Internet Thuggin. Next minute You Want An Interview. Come on beloved @talbikweli What We Doing???”</p><p>He continued: “When I saw you with @chrisrock + @davechappelle you expressed that you wanted to put it to bed with YE. So this feels like you trading Integrity for Clout. If you want me to do a sit down with you to be in the “Hot Seat” then call me like a Real One.”</p><p><br>Kweli ultimately responded, criticizing Con for accusing him of “Internet Thuggin” when he’s failed to call out Kanye for his “anti-black” comments.</p><p>“Let’s be clear. I’m not scared of you at all. Nobody is,” Kweli wrote. “Now to be even more clear, I didn’t approve this ask because I have no desire to interview at all. I didn’t ask anyone to email you and frankly I’m upset that my team sent this email because you are not welcome on my show.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/10/dame-dash-reveals-his-top-three-roc-a-fella-albums.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Dame Dash Reveals His Top Three Roc-A-Fella Albums</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 25, 2022</p></a><p>He added: “Your own queens people don’t fuck with you. Me having you on my show would have me looking sus. Speaking of sus, why have you failed to call out @kanyewest anti black nazi ass rhetoric?”</p><p>Kweli then clowned Con by resharing a few old headlines of him apologizing to Drake and Kim Kardashian after starting feuds with them.&nbsp;“sorry ass n*gga,” Kweli wrote.</p><p>Both rapper’s comments come as Kanye West begins to experience a massive fallout resulting from the problematic comments he made regarding Jews, <a class=underline-link href=#>George Floyd</a> and white supremacy <a class=underline-link href=#>on Fox News</a>, Drink Champs and other outlets.</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Adidas,</a> Balenciaga, <a class=underline-link href=#>Chase Bank</a> and <a class=underline-link href=#>even Def Jam</a> have all cut ties with the Chicago star, which Ye recently said during a podcast interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman <a class=underline-link href=#>has been “the happiest day of his life.”</a></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The fallout has also led to Kanye West being stripped of his title as a billionaire.&nbsp;According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Forbes</a>, Ye’s billionaire boys club membership has been revoked following the termination of his lucrative adidas deal.</p><p>Forbes estimated Kanye’s partnership with the German sportswear giant — with whom he developed the hugely successful Yeezy brand — accounted for $1.5 billion of his net worth. Now that he’s been dropped by the company, Ye is reportedly worth closer to $400 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnaYFyfI6toK2klWOwsLrSnqiunZ6Ysm7AwKWgm2WbrLKttYybnJ6eXaCur8XEZq6eq6Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
