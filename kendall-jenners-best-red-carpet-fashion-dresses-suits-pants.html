The brunette beauty is no stranger to the world’s <a href=#>most prominent runways</a>, strutting her stuff for Prada, Chanel, Versace and more.</p><p>Jenner also works behind the scenes, serving as the creative director of the luxury fashion destination FWRD. “I grew up loving fashion and have been incredibly fortunate to work with some of the most brilliant people in this business,” the TV personality said in September 2021. “As FWRD’s Creative Director, I am excited to help curate the site’s offering with emerging designers and brands.”</p><p>Beyond her fashion jobs, the <a href=#>818 Tequila</a> founder also has a huge social media presence. She frequently uses her platforms to show off her style and favorite brands, which run the gamut from luxury fashion houses like The Row to indie brands like House of Sunny.</p><p>Jenner’s style has evolved quite a bit since her early teenage years, but she tends to favor clean lines and minimalist silhouettes that show off her <a href=#>statuesque figure</a>. Oh, and then there is the occasional nearly naked moment (she is, after all, a Kardashian-Jenner sister).</p><p>Of course, the catwalk queen is known to take sartorial risks IRL, too. In 2018, she debuted not one but two different sheer dresses at the Cannes Film Festival that exposed the top half of her figure. She hilariously posted one of the looks to Instagram with the caption, “oops.”</p><p>There’s also the time when the Moon oral care ambassador attended the 2019 Vanity Fair Oscars Party wearing an open-back Rami Kadi bodysuit-gown hybrid that put her legs and hips on full display. The number left very little to the imagination and naturally, sent fans wild.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>These days, Jenner continues to serve up skin-baring and glamorous red carpet ensembles. Take her 2021 Met Gala gown, for example. The Givenchy Haute Couture number channeled Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady — with a super sexy twist, of course. At the 2022 event, she delivered drama in <a href=#>a black ball gown from Prada</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Jenner’s best red carpet looks through the years, from the 2010s to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKnqWdmZyhequxzaecq6tdl7K0wIyrnJ1lk5a%2FsbHTZp2aq5ievK95w6ucrKuVqHq0wcitqmaokaPBtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
