In fact, I don’t even own a scale,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Masked Singer&nbsp;</i></a>panelist, 50, exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, June 7, of her decision to undergo <a href=#>AirSculpt</a> procedures. “I haven’t owned a scale since my 20s because muscle weighs more than fat.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “It was about targeting a certain area. You know, I literally, <a href=#>work out two hours a day</a>. You could tell I’m a fit person, so for me to have this annoying thing when I would sit down or like that my pants wouldn’t fit or there’s a little cheese when I slouch over. I was like, ‘God, for <a href=#>all the work that I’m putting into working out</a> and trying so hard to not have that go away was really frustrating and taking a toll.’ I almost wanted to give up. I’m like, ‘Forget it. Why am I even go to the gym?’ So when I saw that this was a solution and how easy of a procedure it was to do, I was like, ‘Sign me up!’”</p><p class=p1>McCarthy used AirSculpt on her waist and <a href=#>AirSculpt+</a> on her abdomen to remove fat and instantly tighten her skin. The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>John Tucker Must Die</a>&nbsp;</i>actress also underwent a fat transfer on her hands <a href=#>to help combat signs of aging.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jenny-McCarthy-Explains-Why-Doesnt-Own-a-Scale-or-Use-Ozempic-2.jpg><p class=p1>“As women, we hear the, ‘Oh no, when you get older you’re gonna get that tire on your belly. There’s nothing you can do.’ And I always thought I was kind of invincible ‘cause I was a jock in school,” McCarthy told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “I’m like, ‘I played every sport. I’ve worked out forever. I’m not gonna have that problem’ cut to no matter how much I tried to intermittent fast [to combat aging, its side effects persist]. And I’m not an Ozempic person. I wanted a permanent solution to a targeted area with a bonus of fixing my hands — and that’s what I got.”</p><p class=p1>Ozempic has recently become a hot-button issue in terms of diet trends with <a href=#>many celebrities even using the weight loss drug</a> — which was designed to help diabetes patients and individuals who struggle with obesity to manage their weight — to shed a few pounds. Doctors <a href=#>have since warned casual Ozempic and Wegovy patients</a> that the weight loss does not stick when they stop taking the medication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jenny-McCarthy-Explains-Why-Doesnt-Own-a-Scale-or-Use-Ozempic-1.jpg><p class=p1>McCarthy, however, is <a href=#>not going to “shame” celebrities who have chosen</a> to try the now-controversial drug.</p><p class=p1>“You know what, I think whatever suits someone’s needs. If you fall into the category where you think it’s right for you, I am not gonna shame you. I’ll support anything people want to do,” the&nbsp;<i>Two and Half Men&nbsp;</i>alum said on Wednesday. “For me in particular, I knew that it was not permanent, I knew that<a href=#> a lot of people that go off of it</a>, they regain their weight. And for me, I was like, ‘No, if I’m going to do something and I’ve done all the work I could [and] I’ve exhausted every other avenue in terms of fitness and nutrition.’ AirSculpt seemed like the best solution and it still does to me — to have permanently removed makes sense to me.”</p><p class=p1>After her minimally invasive procedure, McCarthy and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Donnie Wahlberg</strong></a>, were equally wowed by the results.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“He was blown away. You know, because we’ve all tried things, including Donnie. And so when I came back and he saw immediate results, he was like, ‘Jenny, this is amazing,’” she gushed of the<a href=#> New Kids on the Block</a> crooner, 53, <a href=#>whom she wed in 2014</a>. “Every single day he says something to me. … He’s like, ‘Listen, I loved you before. I love you after. I love you every day.’ But he’s enjoying that I’ve got this, like, sculpted curve now.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnZ6jxm65wpyYq6yYrnqmxM%2BlmKKmo2LEqcWMrJ%2BeZZSksrS602amsKZdlnq0r8ClnGanomLCtLGMqLGepaCesHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogPaper - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
