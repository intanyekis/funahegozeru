Even so, it doesn’t seem like there was any animosity between the two boy bands, as Lance stated told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that their competitiveness was friendly in nature and “fun,” and he confessed to being “jealous of a lot of their songs.” He described how he really enjoyed the music of both 98 Degrees and The Backstreet Boys, even though record labels and the media tried to create some sort of dislike between them.</p><p>“It was an outright competition,” Bass said. “We didn’t really know each other and the record label would like to pit us together like Christina [<a href=#>Aguilera</a>] and Britney [Spears].”</p><p>When asked who he preferred, Aguilera’s “Genie in a Bottle” or <a href=#>Spears</a>’ “Hit Me Baby One More Time”, Lance replied without hesitation: “I gotta have my girl, Britney.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>BACKSTREET BOYS AND NSYNC RIVALRY ON GLEE</a></strong></p><p>“I remember she gave me the CD single before it was even out and I remember listening to it and I was like wow this is good,” Bass reminisced. “I listened to it again and I was like this is really great, by the fourth time I was like this is a hit and it didn’t take off for months.”</p><p>Even though Lance and the rest of the ‘NSync cast loved <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, he recalls a not-so-welcoming response from some of ‘NSync’s female fans when Britney was on tour with ‘NSync and first starting out.</p><p>“I remember the first half of the tour she was getting booed off the stage, the girls didn’t like her,” Bass said. “About halfway through the tour, the song started to catch on and by the end of the tour she was a superstar.”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE BOYBANDS WITH THE HOTTEST GIFS</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this ‘90s reminiscing is brought upon by <a href=#>MTV’s upcoming show</a>, <i>90’s House, </i>which Lance will be co-hosting along with <a href=#>Christina Milian</a>.</p><p>When asked to describe <i>90s House, </i>Bass stated, “It's a game show kind of like <a href=#><i>Big Brother</i></a> where these millennials move into a house and they get unplugged from the world. No cell phones, they have AOL dial-up, have a bop-it, wear terrible clothes.” <i>90s House </i>will be premiering on Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017 at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p>Which side of the 90s boy band rivalry were you on?
