Could things have really been over between Stevie and <strong>Joseline Hernandex</strong>, 30? She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>could not have been happy</a> if she’s seen the picture! The Love & Hip Hop Atlanta stars reportedly called it quits again after several blowout arguments. ““They broke up again,” a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>close to Joseline</a>&nbsp;previously told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“It all started over Estelita.&nbsp;They started fighting over her and it escalated. Joseline’s accusing of sleeping with Estelita, she says she has the receipts,” the insider said. Stevie’s new protégé has reportedly been driving Joseline crazy since she first appeared on Love & Hip Hop. “Joseline had a very hard time watching the latest episode because Stevie was bringing Estelita around like she was his woman.&nbsp;Stevie warned Joseline that it was coming up but that still didn’t fully prepare her, she got very emotional watching him with Estelita,” a source previously told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BUi9T53lUHX/?taken-by=estelitaquintero</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Things reportedly got so bad between Stevie and Joseline, they couldn’t even appear on the Wendy Williams Show together! “It was Stevie that didn’t want to be on stage with her,” the source revealed. “She says he’s scared of her calling him out on all his dirty deeds and he should be.” Joseline has got to be dealing with a ton of stress between all this drama with Stevie and Estelita and her new little baby <strong>Bonnie Bella</strong>! Hopefully she and Stevie can work together as parents no matter what happens in their relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Stevie J and Estelita could be the next big couple?
