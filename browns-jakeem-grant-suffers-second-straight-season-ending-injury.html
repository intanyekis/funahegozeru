I marvel at his strength, and I know his teammates do as well, so that’s a tough one.”</p><p>He had been in line to be the team’s starting kick and punt returner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/NYPICHPDPICT000026806364-1.jpg><p>However, with the injury, Stefanski indicated that those duties could be split between Donovan Peoples-Jones and Jerome Ford.</p><p>The responsibilities of returning punts could fall on Jones while Ford would then be tapped to return kicks.&nbsp;</p><p>“Obviously, we had high hopes for Jakeem as our returner,” Stefanski said. “We have internal candidates. You know, we’ll always be looking for external candidates as well. So, things that we’re working through right now.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Grant had been drafted in 2016 and had been a solid contributor on special teams during his time with the Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins.</p><p>He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021 after he was traded to Chicago in the middle of the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Stefanski told reporters on Sunday that he had spoken with Grant since the news and complimented the mental fortitude he had shown rehabbing from the injury last year.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ll reiterate because I see it and his teammates see it.
